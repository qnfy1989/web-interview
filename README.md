# Babylon Web technical recruitment test

Thanks for taking the time to complete our frontend coding test!

For this challenge we are asking you to build a page from the Babylon website; the appointment-booking page! Though it has been slightly modified, this is very similar to what we are currently buildling at Babylon.

You can start with forking this repository and off you go.

Good luck!


## Task

* We have provided you with a designs folder that display what we expect the page to look like. The task is only for mobile screens up to **716** in width so don't worry about displaying in larger screens.
* Use our mock API (defined in `config.js`) to display the **User's information** in the page.
* Use the API to send a request for **Booking an appointment**.

## Setup

We recommend using NVM for managing node versions on your machine.

```
brew install nvm
```

...and installing the required node version with the following command:

```
nvm install
```

This repo is using Yarn as it's package manager.

```
brew install yarn
```

Installing packages:

```
yarn install
```

## Client implementation

We would like you to use React. Feel free to add whatever libraries you think are needed for the task's completion
We have provided you with a barebones react project to work on.
To run the client:

```
yarn start
```

We have added [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to the client which allows you to re-use variables in stylesheets. We have also provided some useful constants in [constants.scss](./src/constants.scss).

### Design

The final design of the client should look and feel like the design files we have provided in `/design`.

###Â Pages

* list appointments: `design/appointments.png`
* book an appointment: `design/new-appointment.png`

## API

### `GET /users/:userId`

Returns a `user` object with the following info:

* `firstName`: `String` of the user's first name.
* `lastName`: `String` of the user's last name.
* `avatar`: `String`. Base64 representation of the user's avatar image.
* `dateOfBirth`: `Date`. The user's Date of Birth.
  _NOTE_: `userId` can be any Integer number; the results will not be affected but it **must** be present in the request's endpoint.

### `GET /availableSlots`

Returns:

* `Array` of `Date ISO 8601` that represent the available appointment slots.

### `POST /appointments`

Expects an object in the request's body with the following information:

* `userId`: `Int`. the user's ID that this appointment is for
* `dateTime`: The user's selected time slot as a `Date ISO 8601`.
* `notes`: `String`. Any notes the user added when booking. _note_: not required, can be null.
  The endpoint responds with a 200 status on success.
* `type`: `String`. The type of the appointment like `GP appointment` or `Physio appointment`.

## Bonus points

If you feel like spending a bit more time on this then here are some additions you can make to the page!

#### Pages

* edit family members: `design/edit-family-members.png`
* book an appointment for family member: `design/new-appointment-change-family-member.png`
* homepage: `design/homepage.png`

#### Bonus API

* There is an extra endpoint in our api at: `GET /users/:userId/family-members`. This will return an array of user Id(s) that represent the user's family members. In the design, add the 'Change' button next to the user's name in `design/new-appointment.png`. When pressed, this should allow you to choose a family member instead of the user. This should be reflected in your final `POST` request, where the `userId` should be the family member's rather than the user's.

* Feel free to comment and iterate on the design; we would love to hear your opinion about any aspect of this page.

## Running test

* To display the page first make sure all dependencies have been installed by running `yarn install` and then run `yarn start`.

* In its current state the app allows to display basic user's information on a booking an appointment page and to make an actual request to book an appointment
